# Number Counter


I am doing these exercises in order to solidify my vanilla JS knowledge.
This exercise is a simple Number Counter.
The "-" sign decrements.
The "+" sign increments.
The "Reset" does what you would expect the reset to do :)
To try it out, download the files to your local machine and drag and drop the index.html file into the browser.
Enjoy!
